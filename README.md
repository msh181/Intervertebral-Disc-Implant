# Intervertebral-Disc-Implant
## Assignment Instructions
In this assignment, you need to develop a case report on designing a scaffold/implant for fusing the bone tissue between two intervertebral bodies. This assignment consists of the following tasks:

- Research tissue engineering and briefly summarise the key components of this;
- Research materials currently used to make scaffolds/implants for intervertebral fusion and describe the requirements for an ideal scaffold/implant. Describe, in brief, some of the biology occurring when these scaffold/implants are implanted;
- Choose at least three materials/composites to analyse by using the CES Edupack software to narrow down materials based on the theory of materials selection.
- Describe the pros and cons of each scaffold/implant material (from part 3) and present an opinion on your material of choice.
- Discuss methods that could be used to make the scaffold structure.
- Using a 3D CAD program, design and test a vertebral cage based on your research above.
- Physically print a prototype of your scaffold/implant design using an FDM printer.

Please submit a report containing information on the aspects above. Reports should be around 3,000 words (not including references). Please show the steps taken when designing the scaffold/implant material using the CES Edupack software, and the steps taken to design and test your scaffold/implant.
